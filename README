Logout Box

An simple logout dialog box written in Python. Depends on pygtk, cairo and pango. 
Current works only with Python 2.x branch.

Default keybindings:
b	reboot
s	shutdown
l	logout
h	hibernate
r	suspend
else	cancel

To do:
Modify the geometry of the main window to have curved sides on the left and right.
Implement use of config file for custom commands and keybindings.
And lastly, and hopefully, adapt to python 3.x.

Icons:
The icons used are featured in Aw0ken icon theme.
